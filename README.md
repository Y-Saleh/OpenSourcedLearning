# OpenSourcedLearning

A free, offline-friendly, open-source alternative to paywalled coding platforms.
Practice algorithms, learn to code, and grow your skills — without subscriptions, logins, or locked content.

🚧 Status: Extremely Early Prototype

OpenSourcedLearning is currently in very early development.
Right now, it is a prototype built using Firebase Studio’s Agentic Kit, focused on testing UI flows, local code execution, and basic problem evaluation.

✔️ Current Features

Basic question set available

Only JavaScript execution supported

Early-stage UI and problem runner

Concept testing for offline/local-first learning experience

🛠️ In Progress / Next Steps

OpenSourcedLearning is evolving rapidly. Upcoming updates include:

🔹 More Questions & Exercises

Expanding the current dataset

Adding difficulty levels

Adding categories (Arrays, Strings, Hashmaps, Recursion, etc.)

🔹 Full Python Support

Integrated Python execution

Ability to run user code locally

Cross-language problem support

Local result comparison & feedback

🔹 Better Learning Environment

Modern, clean React/Next.js UI

Real-time code editor improvements

Local progress tracking (IndexedDB)

Zero server dependency (offline-first design)

🎯 Goal of the Project

To build a completely free, open-source, offline-capable coding learning platform inspired by Sololearn/LeetCode — without paywalls, without accounts, and without your data leaving your device.

OpenSourcedLearning aims to:

democratize algorithm learning

provide unlimited access to lessons

help beginners learn Python & JS

be a transparent alternative to locked platforms
